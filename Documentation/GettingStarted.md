#  Getting Started

Add ZerzuraKit to your project like so:

``` swift
import ZerzuraKit
```

Since ZerzuraKit extends a bunch of standard Apple libraries, you'll need to import those frameworks as well to use ZerzuraKit-defined methods. Don't worry, each documentation page will outline what libraries you need to import in order to access functionality (no imports are needed if none are specified).

Select one of the below topics to read up on features and usage:
- [Arrays](Arrays.md)
- [Abstract Data Types](ADTs.md)
- [Date and Time](DT.md)
- [Numbers](Nums.md)
- [UI Elements](UI.md)
- [Device Properties](Device.md)
- [Location Extensions](Location.md)
