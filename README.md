# ZerzuraKit
ZerzuraKit is a new iOS/macOS framework that bundles a diverse set of methods and extensions into a streamlined and easy-to-use package. Build your apps faster with an extensive library of handy methods that allow you to conveniently manage everything from core services to a range of third-party frameworks with an intuitive and lightweight syntax.

Did I mention that it's fully documented in markdown?

Completed Features:
- ZColor, allowing color management across sRGB, HSV, Hex, and CMYK color spaces.
- ZLocation, allowing for storage of CLLocations and address decoding.
- ZDate, allowing for quick generation/localization of date strings.
- ZTime, allowing for quick generation/localization of time strings.
- ZTimer, a more comprehensive timer.
- UIKit extensions that simplify animations for UIViews, image tinting for UIImageViews, and text/color changes for UITextViews.

Currently working on:
- ZSystem, a module that simplifies interactions with device properties and interfaces.
- API call functionality using Alamofire for GET and SwiftyJSON for processing.
- Further SQLite3 abstraction based on SQLite.swift.

New functionality will be added to this repository as it is tested and finalized.
