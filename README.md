ZerzuraKit is a versatile framework for iOS and macOS that bundles a diverse set of methods and extensions into a streamlined package. Have at your disposal an extensive library of convenient methods that allow you to code intuitively and implement complex functionality using lightweight syntax.

Features:
- Manage color values and UIColor/NSColor across sRGB, HSV, Hex, and CMYK color spaces with ZColor.
- Seamlessly decode addresses and manage CLLocation data with ZLocation.
- Accurately determine device region/locale with ZDevice.
- Quickly generate and localize time strings with Date and TimeInterval extensions.
- Compute and convert numbers more conveniently with Int/Double extensions.
- Compare arrays faster and more accurately with subset, intersection, difference, and equivalence extensions.
- Organize and manage objects with abstract data types, (bags as of now, stacks and multimaps to be implemented).
- UIKit and Cocoa extensions that:
    - Add convenient methods and properties for programmatically modifying UI elements.
    - Enable image compression, resize, and asynchronous fetch/display.

Currently being developed in Xcode 11 for iOS 10.0+ and macOS 10.9+.

***NOTICE***

Animations and UI generators are no longer a part of ZerzuraKit. This functionality has been removed and will be implemented in two new upcoming frameworks: InteractionKit (animations and haptics) and RapideKit (declarative UI).
