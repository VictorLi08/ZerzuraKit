# ZerzuraKit
ZerzuraKit is a new iOS/macOS framework that bundles a diverse set of functions into a streamlined and easy-to-use package. Build your apps faster with an extensive library of prebuilt methods that allow you to conveniently manage everything from core services to a range of third-party frameworks with an intuitive and lightweight syntax.

Completed Features:
- Color module, allowing comprehensive management of colors within sRGB, HSV, Hex, and CMYK color spaces.

Currently working on:
- iOS
  - Simplifying Foundation functionality (i.e. Date/Time, Location Services, etc.).
  - API call functionality using Alamofire for GET and SwiftyJSON for processing.
  - Further SQLite3 abstraction based on SQLite.swift.

New functionality will be added to this repository as it is tested and finalized.
